@*The ng-controller directive :
    - defines which controller will be in charge of your view.
    - attaches a controller class to the view. 
  We can attach multiple controller to a single view. *@

@*We can attach a controller object to a DOM element 
using the ng-controller directive on an object, like so:*@

<div ng-controller="HomeController">
    {{Message}}
</div>

@*When a controller is attached it creates a new $scope object for the DOM element.*@
